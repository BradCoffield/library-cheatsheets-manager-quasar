    <p>The thinking with these is to be able to add custom content to cheatsheets. Like maybe an announcement from faculty or from the library about a new resource for the area. Or something like text, images, links about some particular topic.</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Embed a rich text editor for people to create the content?</li>
       <li>How to order them on the cheatsheet? It would be one thing to add a box to the top or the bottom but a major refactor of things to allow for full ordering control of all boxes in a cheatsheet.</li>
       <li>This may be scope creep. But maybe necessary scope creep!</li>
