      <h2>Custom Boxes</h2>
  
      <p>So, I will want to be able to create an id for each. Really, it wouldn't be so unlike weblinks where different boxes can be attached to different guides. 
    </p>

    The real kicker is how I have the ordering setup in the frontend and therefore the backend. I have a default order setup because I foresaw this but I'm not sure how that is going to be done, yet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The other thing is how to I actually put in the content? Do I need to embed a rich text editor that outputs decent code? What about custom classes? Also need to consider other people in the future here and the fact that they may not be coders.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is a useful sidestep to creating whole scaffolds for things like instruction videos (at least at the moment) and is also obviously good for small unique bits in a guide. I need to remind myself of this because part of me thinks it's just better to create the scaffolds for everything.
